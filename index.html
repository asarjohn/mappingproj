    <p>When Citi Bike was launched in 2013, its first set of bikes in Brooklyn were placed in wealthier and whiter areas of the borough. 

 </p>




<p>
In 2019, Lyft, the company that acquired Citi Bike in 2018, announced that an expansion of the bike system would be introduced as a five-year plan. This expansion would place bike stations in several black and brown communities that did not have direct access to Citi Bike. A short time before this announcement, a report from  New York Communities for Change conducted a study that put Citi Bike on the spotlight for not serving these communities for years since the original rollout.

<p>Citi Bike reached unserved areas of Brooklyn this fall, including predominantly black neighborhoods such as Crown Heights, Flatbush, and parts of Bedford-Stuyvesant. The rollout is still in progress, as stations still havenâ€™t reached parts of certain neighborhoods and community districts.

<p> When asked if race or wealth have anything to do with what areas are expanded to, a spokesperson for the NYC Department of Transportation said DOT believes the growth of the system is based on equity and the 2013 launch to parts of Brooklyn and Manhattan were related to population density and an abundance of safe bicycle infrastructure.
